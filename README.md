# Energy Modeling Dashboard

This project began as a technical take-home assessment and has since evolved into an independent personal project. It is a full-stack web application that enables users to create, view, and modify energy modeling projects and their associated measures.

## Features

- Add, update, and manage energy projects
- Link and track energy-saving measures for each project
- Clean, responsive frontend interface built with React and TypeScript
- RESTful API built with Flask (Python) and connected to a SQLite database
- Server-side validation for reliable and consistent data handling

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python), RESTful API, SQLite
- **Development Tools**: Git, Anaconda, VS Code

## Notes

This project originally stemmed from a take-home assessment. All code and logic are my own, and the repository has been extended and refined as a personal project to further showcase full-stack development skills.
